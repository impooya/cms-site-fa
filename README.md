## Educational CMS Project in Persian (Farsi) ðŸ¤–

### About

This project is based on the educational React course by SabzLearn. The backend has been provided exclusively by the SabzLearn Academy website, and the frontend has been developed by me. It is connected to a MySQL database and a Node.js backend. It has some issues that will be fixed in the future. This project will not be deployed! I designed it only for practice and to challenge myself.
